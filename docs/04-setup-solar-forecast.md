# Solar Forecast Setup

The **Charge** strategy supports a **solar forecast** goal. Instead of charging to a fixed energy level, it calculates how much grid charging is actually needed to charge the battery to its cutoff capacity, based on today's expected solar production. It automatically switches to solar charging (Charge PV) when it hits the calculated level.
This way you optimise self-use and prevent unnescesarry exports to grid.

## How It Works

When the charge goal is set to **solar forecast**, a dashboard distribution card shows the split between `grid charge` and expected `solar charge`.

- If the forecast covers the full battery capacity, no grid charging is needed.
- If the forecast only partially covers it, only the remaining portion is charged from the grid. 

```
solar_surplus  ~= forecast_today − reserved_for_house
charge_target  ~= max_battery_energy − solar_surplus
```

This calculation updates automatically whenever any input changes (forecast value, threshold, or battery capacity).

## Step 1 - Prerequisites

You need a solar forecast integration installed in Home Assistant that provides a **daily kWh sensor**. Common options:

| Integration | Sensor example |
|-------------|---------------|
| [Solcast](https://github.com/BJReplay/ha-solcast-solar) | `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_today` |
| [Forecast.Solar](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/forecast_solar/) | `sensor.energy_production_today` |
| [Open-Meteo Solar Forecast](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/open_meteo/) | Varies by configuration |

Any sensor that reports today's expected solar production in **kWh** will work.

## Step 2 - Configuration

- [ ] On the dashboard, set the **Charge goal** to `solar forecast`.
- [ ] Under **Configure your solar forecast**, enter your forecast sensor entity IDs:
   - **Solar forecast sensor (kWh today)** — e.g. `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_today`
   - **Solar forecast sensor (kWh tomorrow)** — e.g. `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_tomorrow`
- [ ] Set **Solar reserved for house** (`house_battery_solar_reserved_for_house`) to your estimated daily household consumption in kWh. Only solar production _above_ this value is considered available for battery charging.
    - 30% of your average daily household energy use as a good starting point.

## Step 3 - Tips

- Start with a conservative **Solar reserved for house** value (e.g. your average daily consumption). You can fine-tune it over time.
- The forecast goal works well with the **Dynamic** strategy: during cheap hours it charges only what solar won't cover, saving grid costs.
- Use **forecast _remaining_ today** instead of **forecast today**, if you want to accuratly charge at late times during the day.
    - e.g. `sensor.solcast_pv_forecast_forecast_remaining_today`

## Dashboard Indicators

When the solar forecast goal is active, the dashboard shows:

| Card / Field | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Charging until reserve is** | The calculated charge target in kWh |
| **Distribution card** | Visual split: available energy, grid charge portion, and solar charge portion |
| **Solar forecast today** | Raw forecast value from your sensor |
| **Solar surplus today** | Forecast minus household reservation |
| **Surplus covers capacity** | Whether solar alone can fill the entire battery from flat to full |

All values update in real time when the forecast, threshold, or battery capacity changes.
